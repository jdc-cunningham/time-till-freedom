I have not been writing much code for myself lately. Just been working, dayjob writing code and then driving Uber Eats. Also been drinking 4 days out of 7.

I've been thinking about this, the main thing to get out of it is a number of months/year(s).

The card/debt is an object and it goes into a calculator to get that value then you sum them.

Breaking things off maybe modulus in months but also the calculation changes as the principal goes down over time.

I just want to see something to work towards/progress.

You can see it with a spreadsheet of reducing balances over time but a definitive number would be nice.
