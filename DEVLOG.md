I am reminded again today why this needs to be the #1 priority in my life

I'm just trapped without having savings/always worrying about losing my job

But I have survived working in a warehouse and what not

I'm just a dumbass, moment I have money I just burn it

It's a self-made problem, I've been fortunate

Calendars can be hard with regard to day splitting I mean they are defined 28/30/31.

A key feature is being able to swap income/automatic dispursement/calculate pay off... as in going from six figs to eating stale figs (ehh terrible pun)

I'm drinking right now, nothing hard just a 6-pack of 9.5% ale

Finally gonna bust out the remarkable 2 again

I have not been writing much code for myself lately. Just been working, dayjob writing code and then driving Uber Eats. Also been drinking 4 days out of 7.

I drive 4PM-11PM on Sat/Sunday after working out beforehand.

I've been thinking about this, the main thing to get out of it is a number of months/year(s).

The card/debt is an object and it goes into a calculator to get that value then you sum them.

Breaking things off maybe modulus in months but also the calculation changes as the principal goes down over time.

I just want to see something to work towards/progress.

You can see it with a spreadsheet of reducing balances over time but a definitive number would be nice.
