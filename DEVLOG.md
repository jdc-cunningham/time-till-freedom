Alright back on, decided to weather the storm

I just donated plasma, while I did start fasting today I just realized how many caloires beer is

So yeah, I gotta stick to my 2 days a week on that which... idk I get done driving uber eats at 11 PM I'm like ehhh let's drink and play video games

But damn a can is 220 calories fuuhhhhhh and I'm drinking 6 boy

I increased my bench today I'm at 260 lbs assisted, it's a bit, I did 4 reps and then I was like oh f

I'm gonna write some brief code, the basic component tabbing system, I've made multiple of these already

6:03 PM
I am reminded again today why this needs to be the #1 priority in my life

I'm just trapped without having savings/always worrying about losing my job

But I have survived working in a warehouse and what not

I'm just a dumbass, moment I have money I just burn it

It's a self-made problem, I've been fortunate

Calendars can be hard with regard to day splitting I mean they are defined 28/30/31.

A key feature is being able to swap income/automatic dispursement/calculate pay off... as in going from six figs to eating stale figs (ehh terrible pun)

I'm drinking right now, nothing hard just a 6-pack of 9.5% ale

Finally gonna bust out the remarkable 2 again

6:26 PM

There is a neat feature I have thought about, it shows falling leaves animated

This is a tough problem because it needs to factor in other uses of money eg. bills which are not debt

Spreadsheet is the goat, it's always there, I use it to wireframe stuff

We'll do it simple, 3 tabs:

- bills
- debt
- income

That'll be the main parts to do the formula

4

will need a home tab

6:43 PM

I don't really have a specific design just something vague, will start building the pieces

6:54 PM
I feel too sad right now to think

I will write something down

F meeeee man I'm broke already... it's crazy how much debt I have and it's not even that much

I'm looking at $100K+ Porsches lmao you're broke and have a day job

No I'm past the Porsche phase, trying to get me that Lotus Exige

7:01 PM

I'll round up too, nearest dollar

Ahh man... it's tough I work 7 days a week and right now I don't want to do shit I just want to drink and be sad lol

7:52 PM

3 9.5% beers in, I think about this meme sometimes this guy's like "there is no passion! ambition! etc..." it's funny

But yeah I've just gotten used to accepting/waiting for this 2 week paycheck

8:55 PM

I need to make debt payment like a drug

Is the $6 caeasar salad that I eat too expensive? Idk... but maybe it buys me another 5 mins of my life

Emotions is so funny

Like here I am healthy, a 6-fig job, all I have to do is say "yes sir"

But I'm sad

So I'm self-sabotaging

Robots don't need emotion

### 10/06/2025

I have not been writing much code for myself lately. Just been working, dayjob writing code and then driving Uber Eats. Also been drinking 4 days out of 7.

I drive 4PM-11PM on Sat/Sunday after working out beforehand.

I've been thinking about this, the main thing to get out of it is a number of months/year(s).

The card/debt is an object and it goes into a calculator to get that value then you sum them.

Breaking things off maybe modulus in months but also the calculation changes as the principal goes down over time.

I just want to see something to work towards/progress.

You can see it with a spreadsheet of reducing balances over time but a definitive number would be nice.
